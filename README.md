## Newsüî•üî•üî•

* :art: The FC-Former convers multiple multi-source image fusion scenes:
  * Multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion;
  * Remote sensing pansharpening;
  * Visible and infrared image fusion (VIS-IR); 
  * Digital photographic image fusion: Multi-focus image fusion (MFF) and multi-exposure image fusion (MEF). 

* üéÅ We will release a new version of [UDL](), [PanCollection](). Furthermore, we also release repositories of [HyperSpectralCollection]() and [MSIF]().

* :eight_pointed_black_star: **The FC-Former employs multilinear algebra to unify and generalize self-attention mechanisms.** One of the generalized self-attention mechanisms is fully-connected self-attention (FCSA).

* üëç The FC-Former achieves the state-of-the-art performance with less parameter number and have a powerful potential in feature representation, which is a win-win situation.



## Quick Start ü§ó
1. Install base training/inference repo with multiple Pytorch framework support. You can select one of backends: accelerate, lightning, transformers, and mmcv1.
```
pip install udl_vis --upgrade
```
2. Install the [Task] repo by populating one of the following repos: ``pancollection``, ``mhif`` ``msif``.

``` 
pip install [Task] --upgrade
```

3. Then in this repository:
```
pip install -e .
```



## Train
Here, we take Huggingface ``accelerate`` as the backend, thus
```
sh  run_accelerate_ddp_pansharpening.sh
```
The script will call ``python_scripts/accelerate_pansharpening.py`` to run the FC-Former. More information you can see ``model.yaml``


## Inference 
Inference the FC-Former to obtain final results, you only need to update the `model.yaml` as follows:
```yaml
  eval : true # change false to true
  workflow:
    - ["test", 1]
    # - ["train", 10] # comment it
```




## Test Your Metrics
Finally, we provide the correspoinding Matlab toolboxes to test the metrics on those tasks. Please check them in our repo.

* MHIF
  * [HyperSpectralToolbox, comming soon](https://github.com/XiaoXiao-Woo/HyperSpectralToolbox)
  * `run_hisr.m`
  
* Pansharpening
  * [DLPan-Toolbox](https://github.com/liangjiandeng/DLPan-Toolbox)
  
* VIS-IR, MEF, MFF
  * [Image Fusion Toolbox, comming soon]()



## Experiments
In this part, we conduct experiments in the following cases. All settings can be changed in `dataset.yaml`.
* MHIF: CAVE and Harvard. 
  * See our repo [MHIF]() for more details;
* VIS-IR image fusion: TNO and RoadScene datasets. 
  * See our repo [MSIF]() for more details;
* Pansharpening: WorldView-3, GaoFen-2, QuickBird datasets.
  * See our repo [PanCollection]() for more details;
* Digital photographic image fusion: MFF-WHU, MEF-Lytro,MEF-SLICE, MEFB. 
  * See our repo [MSIF]() for more details;
